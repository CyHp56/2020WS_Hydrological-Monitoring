# 3. Unit

## Precipitation
* Ice, snow, hail, graupel, sleet and water (rain, drizle)
* Measured at a point (rain gaug) or estimated over an area (satellite or radar)

## Evapotranspiration
* Conversion of a liquid from its surface into a gas
* Traspiration: The transfer of liquid water from plants into the atmosphere as a vapor
* Actual evaporation and 
* potential evaporation: Amount of Evapotranspiration, that would happen, if a unlimited amount of water would be availabel, the Demand of the Atmosphere
## Water Balance
* How do we decide how much water is ther
### Infiltration
* Diagramm: Infiltration Capacity Curve
* More water infiltrated soil, soil gets saturted and can`t absorb that much water
* Variable Infiltration Curve 
* How much is R?
* What portion of the basin has Wm`greater than this value?
  * IfP
